Terra Satellite: 25 Years of Earth Science ‚Äî User Manual üåçüõ∞Ô∏è
This guide will help you navigate and interact with the Terra Satellite Earth Science Data website. The site is designed to showcase 25 years of data collected by the NASA Terra satellite and its five onboard instruments.

1. Overview
The website is divided into four main sections, accessible via the top navigation bar:

Home: A dynamic introduction featuring a rotatable 3D Earth model and an overview of the mission.

Data: Interactive charts demonstrating long-term trends in global climate data (Temperature, CO

‚Äã
  Levels, Ice Coverage, and Vegetation).

Query: A custom form that simulates querying satellite data for a specific date and location.

Impact: Story-driven content explaining how the Terra satellite's data affects real-world issues like climate change, air quality, and biodiversity.

2. Home Section
The Home section features the main title, mission summary, and a dynamic 3D Earth visualization.

2.1. Interacting with the 3D Earth Model
The stylized globe displays simulated Earth data (like atmospheric and heat overlays).

Rotation: Click and drag (or touch and drag on mobile) the globe to rotate it horizontally and vertically.

Zoom: Use your mouse scroll wheel (or pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices) to zoom in and out of the Earth.

Information Overlay: The "heat-overlay" animation pulsing on the globe visually represents data like rising temperatures or atmospheric CO

2.2. Sticky Instrument Navigation
As you scroll down the page, a sticky navigation bar appears at the top. This bar highlights the five major instruments on the Terra satellite.

Instrument	Icon	Primary Role (Simulation)
ASTER	<i class="fas fa-mountain"></i>	High-resolution land surface temperature, emissivity, and elevation.
CERES	<i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i>	Measures Earth's radiation budget (solar energy reflected/emitted).
MISR	<i class="fas fa-camera"></i>	Multi-angle imaging to study aerosols, clouds, and surface properties.
MODIS	<i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i>	Large-scale, moderate-resolution data on the land, atmosphere, and oceans.
MOPITT	<i class="fas fa-smog"></i>	Monitors atmospheric pollution, specifically carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations.

Export to Sheets
Selecting an Instrument: Click on any instrument card. While this action is primarily for demonstration, in a fully functional application, it would filter or load data specific to that instrument.

3. Data Visualization Section
This section displays historical trends derived from Terra and related NASA mission data.

3.1. Viewing Data Charts
Use the four buttons to switch between different long-term visualizations:

Temperature: Shows global temperature anomaly over time.

CO 
2
‚Äã
  Levels: Shows the rise in atmospheric CO

‚Äã
  (parts per million).

Ice Coverage: Shows the trend in Arctic sea ice extent (million square kilometers).

Vegetation: Shows changes in the Global Vegetation Index (NDVI), indicating planetary "greenness."

Chart Interaction: Hover over the line on any chart to see the specific data value and year.

Timeline: The animated progress bar at the bottom visually represents the timeline of data acquisition from the Terra launch year (1999) up to the present (2024).

4. Custom Data Query Section
Use this tool to simulate requesting specific, localized satellite data for any date from December 18, 1999, to the current date.

4.1. Submitting a Query
Date: Select a date between 1999-12-18 and today.

Location: Enter a geographical location (e.g., "New York, USA").

Latitude/Longitude: Enter the coordinates for the center of your search area.

Latitude: -90 to 90

Longitude: -180 to 180

Dataset: Select one of the available environmental variables (e.g., Temperature, Aerosol Optical Depth, Cloud Properties).

Area Size (km): Enter a radius for the data search (1-100 km).

4.2. Viewing Results
Click the "Query Data" button.

The page will display a Query Results box with simulated data for the selected location, date, and dataset.

Value: The simulated or mock measurement (e.g., temperature in ¬∞C, NDVI value).

Unit: The corresponding unit of measurement (e.g., ¬∞C, NDVI, g/kg).

Quality: The simulated data quality rating ("Good" in this demo).

Note: Due to API access limitations, the data returned is a highly simplified, often mocked, result to demonstrate functionality, not real-time satellite data.

5. Impact Stories Section
This section provides narrative examples of how Terra's data contributes to scientific understanding and real-world policy.

5.1. Exploring the Impact
Three key impact areas are detailed:

Climate Change & Extreme Weather

Air Quality & Public Health

Ecosystems & Biodiversity

"Learn More" Button: Click the "Learn More" button under any story to open a pop-up window (Modal) with a more detailed explanation of Terra's role in that area.

Closing the Modal: Click the '√ó' icon in the top right corner or click anywhere outside the pop-up window to close it.
